# The last 24 hours, as a list a person can read: every change of state, and
# after each spell of uploading, one line saying what it amounted to.
#
# The state changes come free from the poll loop. The summary line is the part
# that needs a little care: the client's state flickers between Transmitting and
# its neighbours while it works through small files, so a spell of uploading is
# not "state == Transmitting" but "Transmitting, allowing gaps of up to a
# minute". Splitting on every flicker would give a log of one-minute spells that
# says nothing; one line per real spell says how the backup is doing.
#
# Files and bytes are counted from the completed transfers the monitor already
# tracks. Rows present when the spell starts belong to an earlier one and are
# not counted; a multi-part file's bytes are taken as they stand at the end, not
# at first sight; and a small file the datacenter already held is counted as
# checked, not as uploaded. Rate, threads, memory and swap are means over the
# samples taken while uploading. A long spell gets a line every hour so a day of
# uploading is not one line at the end of it.
