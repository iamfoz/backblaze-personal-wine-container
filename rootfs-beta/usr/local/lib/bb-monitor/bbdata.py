"""Shared data layer for bb-monitor and bb-monitor-web.

Both dashboards read the same things: /proc, the cgroup files, and Backblaze's
own bzdata logs and XML. Everything that does the reading lives here so the two
front ends cannot drift apart. They did drift: the web dashboard gained overall
backup progress, an ETA, files remaining and round-trip time while the terminal
one kept the original narrower view, because each carried its own copy of this
code. A feature added here now appears in both or neither.

No curses, no HTTP, no subprocesses. Pure reads plus one netlink socket for the
kernel's own round-trip-time figures. The front ends own presentation and
nothing else.

Imported by path rather than installed as a package, since both callers live in
/usr/local/bin and this is deliberately not a general-purpose library:
