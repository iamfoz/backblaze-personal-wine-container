# Key store for the /api/v1 surface, shared by bb-monitor-web and bb-apikey.
#
# A consumer outside the browser cannot reach the monitor's data any other way:
# it runs on the host or elsewhere on the network, the data is inside the
# container, and /monitor/ sits behind nginx's auth_request, which expects a
# browser session. So /api/v1 is exempted from that and defends itself with a key.
#
# The surface is live when an unrevoked key exists AND the switch is on. The
# switch exists so a key can be kept, wired into a dashboard, while the API is
# turned off for a while; without it the only way off was to revoke and the only
# way back was a new key in every consumer. With no key there is nothing to
# switch, and a fresh container answers 404 rather than 403 on every /api/v1
# path: a 403 would confirm the endpoint is there.
